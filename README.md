I am a Ph.D. student of the Computational Analysis and Modeling of Medical Activities (CAMMA) led by [Prof. Nicolas PADOY](https://camma.unistra.fr/npadoy/) and Computer Aided Medical Procedures (CAMP) led by [Prof. Nassir NAVAB](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/navab-nassir). I am interested in AI in interventional healthcare. [My recent works](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zId4EqoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) focus on the multi-modal solution for versatile surgical scene understanding and reasoning. I have also interned with [Deep Bit Lab](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/lizhen/) in CHUK-SZ and [OpenMMLAB](https://openmmlab.com/) in Beijing.
